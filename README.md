# Machine-Learning-DNHS

1. Prior to any analyses, we need to clean the data and select the samples and GRRN genes for Machine Learning. Run `Prepare Data ML 1.ipynb` for cleaning the data.
2. Next we need to select the important features in our data, run `Feature Selection Epic ML 2.ipynb` for feature selection.
3. Build the Machine learning models on the clean data using `Epic_ML_3.ipynb`
4. Code to perform analysis without some important features is in `Epic_ML_2-revision.ipynb'. This analysis was requested in manuscript revisions. 
5. Run `Plot_Epic_ML_4.ipynb` for plotting.
6. To check the demography of the samples use `EPIC Samples Demography.ipynb`
